Intro: #done

Buy Order: #done
A client advisor logs in to Genie, our AI-powered assistant built for seamless trade execution and client management.

From the dashboard, the advisor selects the desired client — Anna Berchtold — whose portfolio is displayed in real time.

With a few simple commands, the advisor initiates a buy order for 500 shares of Tesla.

Genie understands the intent, performs all necessary validations and pre-trade checks — and prepares the order for submission.

Once everything is verified, Genie interfaces directly with the Order Management System to place the trade securely and efficiently.

The order is confirmed instantly, and a client order ID is generated for tracking.
